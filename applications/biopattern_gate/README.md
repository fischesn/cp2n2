# BioPattern Gate

BioPattern Gate is the access-independent application core for the Cortical
Labs case study. Two hidden, charge-equivalent logical input patterns differ
only in temporal order. A dynamic reservoir response is converted into a
small, fixed feature vector and passed to a frozen linear readout. The
committed decision routes the result to the `left` or `right` gate before the
expected label is revealed.

The current `technical-e3` path is deliberately a deterministic test double.
It proves orchestration, blinding, provenance, validation, abort behavior, and
replayability. It is not a biological result and its accuracy must not be
reported as PNN performance.

Run the local demonstration from the repository root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_biopattern_gate_demo.py
```

Run the same frozen application through the complete constrained CP²N²
lifecycle (including dry run, exclusive lease, prepare, execute, result,
audit references, and automatic release):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_biopattern_gate_mcp_e3.py
```

The MCP result exposes only a sanitized aggregate and checksum-bearing
artifact references. It binds the server-owned preset to exact application
source, configuration, and decoder hashes. No raw spike events or physical
control parameters cross the agent boundary.

## Visual replay demo

The paper-oriented dashboard combines two recorded evidence sources:

- deterministic simulated trial observations for the gate, neural, and
  decision views; and
- a real execution through the constrained MCP surface for the control-plane
  view, including the MCP request transcript, hash-chained audit log,
  LifecycleStore transitions, sanitized result reference, and automatic lease
  release.

The checked-in control-plane capture is verified whenever the visual replay
bundle is regenerated. The resulting dashboard remains a replay: it does not
contact a substrate or execute MCP calls while it is being viewed. Start it
from an activated virtual environment:

```powershell
python scripts\serve_biopattern_gate_demo.py
```

The command opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. Use `--no-open` when the browser
should not be opened automatically. The dashboard is unmistakably labeled
`E3`, `REPLAY`, `MCP AUDITED`, and `NO BIOLOGICAL CLAIM`; its score is a
deterministic pipeline assertion, not PNN performance.

The recorded source evidence lives in
`evaluation/fixtures/biopattern-gate-control-plane-e3-transcript-v1.json` and
`evaluation/fixtures/biopattern-gate-control-plane-e3-audit-v1.jsonl`. Verify
their binding to the visual bundle with:

```powershell
python scripts\export_biopattern_gate_demo_bundle.py --check
```

A user-oriented explanation of every visible area and its evidence meaning is
available in
[`docs/biopattern-gate-web-demo-guide.md`](../../docs/biopattern-gate-web-demo-guide.md).

Verify that the checked-in JSON Schema matches the frozen configuration model:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\export_biopattern_gate_schema.py --check
```

## Hardware boundary

The core exposes a narrow `BioPatternGatePort`. A future CL1 implementation
must translate provider-approved logical groups and protocol references into
the actual SDK calls. The repository intentionally contains no executable
provider preset. Hardware modes fail validation unless all of the following
are present:

- `provider_approved` preset namespace;
- attested `cl1` runtime and E5 evidence context;
- verified provider API contract;
- exact approval references;
- calibration reference;
- matching frozen decoder and configuration hashes.

The provider-approved namespace remains empty until those facts can be
verified with the granted Cortical Labs environment.
